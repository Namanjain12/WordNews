\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have described {\tt WordNews}, a software extension and server
backend to transform the web browser into a second language learning
platform.  Leveraging web-based machine translation APIs and a static
dictionary, it offers a viable user-driven language learning
experience by pairing an improved, context-sensitive tooltip
definition capability with the generation of context-sensitive
multiple choice questions.


{\tt WordNews} is potentially not confined to use in news websites; one
respondent noted that they would like to use it on arbitrary websites,
but currently we feel usable word sense disambiguation is difficult
enough even in the restricted domain.  We also note that respondents
are more willing to use a mobile client for news reading, such that
our future development work may be geared towards an independent
mobile application, rather than a browser extension. In the future, we also plan to conduct longitudinal study with real second language learners, to evaluate the effectiveness of our software in language learning.

\section{Evaluation}
There are a few standard aspects that can be evaluated from the Chrome Extension part, such as User Interface (UI) design, loading speed and the functionality. UI design and functionality are more related to front end, while the loading speed is highly correlated to the back end. As this project is a joint work, and I am responsible  for the front end, I limit my focus to evaluate the UI design and functionality by surveying users.

Also, as mentioned in the above chapters, we did a user requirement survey before we really start this project. From this survey, we roughly know  our potential customers' expectation and we need to check whether our Chrome Extension could satisfy them. I got 16 different responses, 15 of them are between 18 and 24, and 11 of them are professional in Chinese.

For the details of the survey questions and survey results, please refer to the Appendix. In this survey, I made some screen shots of our Chrome Extension and ask subjects about their opinions.

Most of them think that replacing some words with their corresponding Chinese translation will not influence their normal reading, but they will feel a bit uncomfortable and prefer to read the original English articles. Based on their voice, I decide to highlight the original English words as default setting instead of replacing the English words with their Chinese Translations. Besides, most subjects think our Chrome Extension is nice and would like to try it when they are going to learn a new language.

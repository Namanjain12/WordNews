\section{Evaluation}
This project has two main research parts, Distractors Generation algorithm and WSD system. To evaluate the distractors selection strategy, the best way to evaluate is to listen to users' voice. The WSD system is a standard research problem and can be evaluated with ground-truth, reporting its performance
%tested from a few very standard aspects, 
by coverage and accuracy.

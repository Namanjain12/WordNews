\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We described WordNews, a client extension and server backend that
transforms the web browser into a second language learning platform.
Leveraging web-based machine translation APIs and a static dictionary,
it offers a viable user-driven language learning experience by pairing
an improved, context-sensitive tooltip definition service with the
generation of context-sensitive multiple choice questions.

WordNews is potentially not confined to use in news websites; one
respondent noted that they would like to use it on arbitrary websites,
but currently we feel usable word sense disambiguation is difficult
enough even in the restricted news domain.  We also note that
respondents are more willing to use a mobile client for news reading,
such that our future development work may be geared towards an
independent mobile application, rather than a browser extension.  We
also plan to conduct a longitudinal study with a cohort of second
language learners to better evaluate WordNews' real-world effectiveness.

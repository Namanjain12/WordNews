\section{Introduction}
Learning a new language from language learning websites is 
time consuming. It is, therefore, necessary to make second 
language learning attractive and efficient. Further, since habitual 
learning is effective, we seek to interleave language leaning with 
a popular daily activity. Reading news online is once such 
activity. 
% Muthu: can you find a citation that says lot of people read new online?.
Further recent increase in the popularity of 
portable devices has made online news reading popular than ever 
before~\cite{yarlh2012}. We leverage on this culture to provide 
users of news websites with an opportunity to learn a second 
language.

We propose a system to enable online news readers to efficiently learn 
a new language while they are reading news on news websites. We propose 
a Chrome extension which would run on the client (Chrome web browser) 
when readers visit news websites on a preconfigured list.

% Muthu: can you ealborate a liitle bit? That is, find a citaion that says
% grammar learning, etc., is less important or useful than learning vocabulary (words)
% in a new second langauge 
Learning a new vocabulary is the most time consuming and boring part of 
language learning\footnote{\url{https://neltachoutari.wordpress.com/tag/vocabulary/}}. 
Perhaps, this justifies the poor adoption of current second language learning 
systems. We, therefore, focus on enabling language learners build their vocabulary 
efficiently while providing them with an enjoyable user experience.

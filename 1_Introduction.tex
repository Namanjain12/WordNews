\section{Introduction}
People read news every day. With the increasing popularity of 
portable devices and computers, more and more people are reading 
news from news websites \cite{yarlh2012}.
\\
We leverage on this culture to provide users of news websites 
with an opportunity to learn a second language.
Learning a new language from language learning websites is very time consuming. 
To this end, we propose a system to enable visitors to news websites to 
efficiently learn a new language while they are reading news. We propose to 
build the system as a Chrome extension which would run on the client side 
when readers visit news websites from preconfigured list.
\\
Learning a new vocabulary is the most time consuming and boring part of 
language learning\footnote{\url{https://neltachoutari.wordpress.com/tag/vocabulary/}}. Perhaps, this justifies the 
poor adoption of current second language learning systems. We, therefore, 
focus on enabling language learners build their vocabulary efficiently while 
providing them with an enjoyable user experience.

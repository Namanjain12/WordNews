%Learning a second language is difficult
%and requires constant revision and immersion.
%Fortunately, many of us read news
%online everyday. In this paper, we propose
%a web browser extension that allows
%a reader to learn a second language vocabulary
%while reading news online. We hypothesize
%Since we find a wordâ€™s context to be useful
%in learning a vocabulary, we further
%use word sense disambiguation (WSD) to
%show the best translation for each word in
%the context. Our proposed WSD method,
%leveraging the extension of standard machine
%translation system, significantly betters
%baseline methods in both coverage
%and accuracy. We also elaborate on
%the issues of determining appropriate distractors
%for multiple-choice word mastery
%quizzes .
%We conducted a user survey to evaluate
%our system against user requirements collected
%through an earlier survey.


Learning a second language is difficult and requires
constant revision and immersion.  Fortunately, many of us 
read news online everyday. In this paper, we propose a web browser extension that allows readers to learn a second language vocabulary 
while reading news online. To this end, we propose algorithms to disambiguate  word sense and translate the words in new articles properly 
to target langauge.
%for translating source language words in news articles to target 
%language. We find that a standard machine translation system extended 
%with a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system significantly betters baseline translation methods in both coverage and accuracy.
We find a machine translation based method significantly betters baselines in both coverage and accuracy.
We also propose techniques for generating appropriate distractors for multiple-choice word mastery quizzes for assessing language learners.
We conducted a user survey to evaluate our system.

\begin{abstract}


We propose a web browser extension that allows readers to learn a
second language vocabulary while reading news online.  Injected
tooltips allow readers to look up selected vocabulary and give
interactive tests to assess vocabulary mastery.  

We discover that two key system components needed improvement, both
which stem from the need to model context.  These two issues are in
practice word sense disambiguation (WSD) to aid translation quality
and constructing the interactive tests. We start with Microsoft's Bing
translation API but employ additional dictionary based heuristics that
significantly improve translation quality over a baseline in both
coverage and accuracy. We also propose techniques for generating
appropriate distractors for multiple-choice word mastery tests.  Our
preliminary user survey confirms the need and viability of such a
language learning platform.

\begin{abstract}
Learning a second language is difficult and requires
constant revision and immersion.  Fortunately, many of us take the
time to update ourselves through reading news on a daily basis.  
In this paper, we merge both of these goals into a Web browser extension that allows a reader to learn and master vocabulary items. 
We conducted a user survey to evaluate our system against user requirements collected through an earlier survey. Since we find a word's context to be useful in learning a vocabulary, we further adopt word sense disambiguation (WSD)
technique to show the best translation for each word in the context.
Our proposed WSD method, leveraging the extension of standard machine translation system, significantly betters baseline methods in both coverage and accuracy.

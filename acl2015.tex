\begin{abstract}


We propose {\tt WordNews}, a web browser extension that allows readers to learn a
second language vocabulary while reading news online.  Injected
tooltips allow readers to look up selected vocabulary and give
interactive tests to assess vocabulary mastery.  

We discover that two key system components needed improvement, both
which stem from the need to model context.  These two issues are
real-world word sense disambiguation (WSD) to aid translation quality
and constructing interactive tests. For the first, we start with
Microsoft's Bing translation API but employ additional
dictionary-based heuristics that significantly improve translation in
both coverage and accuracy. For the second, we propose techniques for
generating appropriate distractors for multiple-choice word mastery
tests.  Our preliminary user survey confirms the need and viability of
such a language learning platform.

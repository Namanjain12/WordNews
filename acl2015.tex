%Learning a second language is difficult
%and requires constant revision and immersion.
%Fortunately, many of us read news
%online everyday. In this paper, we propose
%a web browser extension that allows
%a reader to learn a second language vocabulary
%while reading news online. We hypothesize
%Since we find a wordâ€™s context to be useful
%in learning a vocabulary, we further
%use word sense disambiguation (WSD) to
%show the best translation for each word in
%the context. Our proposed WSD method,
%leveraging the extension of standard machine
%translation system, significantly betters
%baseline methods in both coverage
%and accuracy. We also elaborate on
%the issues of determining appropriate distractors
%for multiple-choice word mastery
%quizzes .
%We conducted a user survey to evaluate
%our system against user requirements collected
%through an earlier survey.


We propose a web browser extension that allows readers to learn a
second language vocabulary while reading news online.  Injected
tooltips allow readers to look up selected vocabulary and give
interactive tests to assess vocabulary mastery.  

We discover that two key system components needed improvement, both
which stem from the need to model context.  These two issues are in
practical word sense disambigution (WSD) to aid translation quality
and constructing the interactive tests. We start with Microsoft's Bing
translation API but employ additional dictionary based heuristics that
significantly improve translation quality over a baseline in both
coverage and accuracy. We also propose techniques for generating
appropriate distractors for multiple-choice word mastery tests.  Our
preliminary user survey confirms the need and viability of such a
language learning platform.

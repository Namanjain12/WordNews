For Users
========

Install the chrome extension into chrome. This can be done, as of the time of writing, by going to
the url “chrome://extensions” and dragging the folder onto the page. Enable the extension.

A logo will appear at the top-right corner of the browser, beside the address bar. By clicking on
it, a list of settings will appear. To use the extension, the extensions must be turned on, with a
non-zero number of words to translate, and the website to use the extension on must be enabled.

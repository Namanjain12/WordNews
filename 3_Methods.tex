\section{The WordNews Chrome Extension}

Our method to directly enhance the web browser is inspired by earlier
work in the computer-aided language learning community that also uses
the web browser as the delivery vehicle for language learning.  WERTi
\cite{metcalf06:_gener_web_based_englis_prepos,meurers2010} was a
monolingual, user-driven system that modified web pages in the target
language to highlight or remove certain words from specific syntactic
patterns to teach difficult-to-learn English grammar.

\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}
Our focus is to help build Chinese vocabulary for second language
learners fluent in English.  We give a running scenario to illustrate
the use of WordNews.  When a learner browses to an English webpage on
a news website, our extension either selectively replaces certain
original English words with their Chinese translation
% Tao2: added 
or underlines the English words, based on user configuration
(Figure~\ref{fig:chrome_extension_1}, middle).  While the meaning of
the Chinese word is often apparent in context, the learner can choose
to learn more about the replaced/underlined word, by mousing over the
word to reveal a definition tooltip
(Figure~\ref{fig:chrome_extension_1}, left) to aid mastery of the
Chinese word.  Once the learner has encountered the target word a few
times, WordNews assesses learner's mastery by generating a multiple
choice translation test on the target word
(Figure~\ref{fig:chrome_extension_1}, right). Our learning platform
thus can be viewed as three logical use cases: {\it translating}, {\it
  learning} and {\it testing}. \\

{\bf Translating.}  We pass the main content of the webpage from the
extension client to our server for candidate selection and
translation.  As certain words are polysemous, the server must select
the most appropriate translation among all possible meanings. Our
initial selection method replaces any instance of words stored in our
dictionary. For translation, we check the word's stored meanings
against the machine translation of each sentence obtained from the
Microsoft Bing Translation API\footnote{\url{https://www.bing.com/translator/}} 
(hereafter, ``Bing'').  Matches are
deemed as correct translations and are pushed back to the Chrome
client for rendering.

{\bf Learning.} Hovering the mouse over the replacement Chinese word
causes a tooltip to appear, which gives the translation,
pronunciation, and simplified written form, and a {\tt
  More} link that loads additional contextual example sentences (that
were previously translated by the backend) for the learner to study.
The  {\tt More}  link must be clicked for activation, as we find this
two-click architecture helps to minimize latency and the loading of
unnecessary data.  The server keeps record of the learning tooltip
activations, logging the enclosing webpage URL, the target word and
the user identity.

{\bf Testing.}  After the learner encounters the same word a
pre-defined number $t=3$ times, WordNews generates a multiple choice
question (MCQ) test to assess mastery.  When the learner hovers over
the replaced word, the test is shown for the learner to select the
correct answer. When an option is clicked, the server logs the
selection and updates the user's test history, and the client reveals
the correct answer.

\subsection{News Categories}
\label{subsec:category}
As our learning platform is active only on certain news websites, we
can model the news category (for individual words and whole webpages)
as additional evidence to help with tasks.  Of particular importance
to WordNews is the association of words to a news category, which is
used downstream in both word sense disambiguation
(Section~\ref{sec:wsd}) and the generation of distractors in the
interactive tests (Section~\ref{sec:distractor}).  Here, our goal is
to automatically find highly relevant words to a particular news
category -- {\it e.g.}, ``what are typical {\it finance} words?''

We first obtain a large sample of categorized English news webpages,
by creating custom crawlers for specific news websites~({\it e.g.}
CNN).  We use a seed list of words that are matched against a target
webpage's URL.  If any match, the webpage is deemed to be of that
category.  For example, a webpage that has the seed word ``football''
in its URL is deemed of category ``Sports''.  Since the news category
is also required for Chinese words for word sense disambiguation, we
must perform a similar procedure to crawl Chinese news ({\it e.g.},
BaiduNews\footnote{\url{http://news.baidu.com}}) However, Chinese news
sites follow a different categorization scheme, so we first manually
align the categories based on observation (see Table~\ref{table:cat}),
creating seven bilingual categories: namely, ``World'',
``Technology'', ``Sports'', ``Entertainment'', ``Finance'',
``Fashion'' and ``Travel''.

% Tao: please check the example words.

%    Travel  &  & ``natural'', \\
%    \hline
%   Health &  & ``stress'' \\
%    \hline

%\end{table}

We tokenize and part-of-speech tag the main body text of the
categorized articles, discarding punctuation and stopwords.  For
Chinese, we segment words using the Stanford Chinese word
segmenter~\cite{Chang2008}. The remaining words are classified to a
news category based on document frequency. A word $w$ is classified to
a category $c$ if it appears more often (a tunable threshold
$\delta$\footnote{We empricially set $\delta$ to $10$.}) than its
average category document frequency.  Note that a word can be
categorized to multiple categories under this scheme.

%% A word w is classified into category C(i) if it satisfies Equation~\ref{equation:Distractor_3}::
%% \begin{equation}
%% f (w, C(i)) - sw(w)/n >= \delta
%% \label{equation:Distractor_3} 
%% \end{equation}  

%% The confidence factor $\delta$ can be a positive integer between 0 and the average number of articles in each category. It means on average, the word w must appear in a specific category C(i) $\delta$ times more than it appear in other category before it can be classified into category C(i).

%% It is obvious that a higher confidence factor value will result in less number words getting classified, but it will result in getting words that are more accurate. A suitable confident value is selected to generating category-related words in the later section.
